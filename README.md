# Breakout-Game
Author : Tushar Asthana

# Installations:
Make sure to have GLFW and glad installed.
CLion is the IDE that I used as this game is created in C++. 

# Summary:
This program is a simple Breakout game implemented in C++ using the OpenGL graphics framework (GLFW). 
The game involves controlling a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks on the screen. 
The user interacts with the game using keyboard inputs to move the paddle.

# Concepts Used:
OpenGL and GLFW for graphics rendering.
Drawing shapes and handling user input for the paddle.
Keyboard input for controlling the paddle.
Use of C++ classes for encapsulating game elements (Paddle, Ball, Brick).
Interactive gameplay with multiple screens within the same graphics window.

# Future Work:
With more time, the program could be expanded by adding and refining collision detection and handling. 
There are a couple TODO's that I left in the code that I didn't have time to get to, but adding graphics for bricks being hit,
a counter for score, and really just figuring out my bugs.
